This is a project I'm making for school that has some creative flexibility.
The project is a wordle clone, a popular game that can be run in the browser made by New York Times.
In order to run the program you need to type "make" into the terminal when inside the folder and run it
by typing "./app" into the terminal
Once the program is ran it will enter the main menu where it will give you 5 different options.
option one lets you play the game, option two lets you read about how to play the game, and option 5 lets you exit the program.
option three and four will be added soon.
Thank you for looking at my project and hope you enjoy!
